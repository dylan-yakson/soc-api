Crappy thing I made to predict peoples emotions from social media scraping and run some automated OSINT strategies 

Also does some network analysis by putting images together from network activity stored in a pcap file 
  Plan was to use images to detect malicious activity but never got around to it
  
Decent at predicting psychometrics from social media activity using a multi-modal approach
