# soc-api

Crappy & unfinished. CLI, really hard to navigate. I'd fix, but its sketchy and I don't want everone running this at scale. F that.

Decent at predicting psychometrics from social media activity using a multi-modal approach though and runs some automated OSINT strategies like unsername enumeration, and facial recognition

Also does some network analysis by putting images together from network activity stored in a pcap file 
  Plan was to use images to detect malicious activity but never got around to it

Makes a local postgres server (assuming you are running debian lol..) and some other stuff to store the results

works for numerous sites:
  well kinda.. really only reddit, linkedin, and twitter
  
  
  
  ...dont judge.
